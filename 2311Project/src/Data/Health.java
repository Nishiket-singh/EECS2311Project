			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Although the World Health Organization (WHO) still considers the global situation related to mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, to be a public health emergency of international concern, Quebec's Ministry of Health had announced on Feb. 14 that the outbreak of mpox had been contained.Montreal public health says in a news release that the two new patients are men who had sex with men, likely outside the country. One had one dose of the vaccine, while the other had two, the release says.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The Imvamune vaccine reduces the risk of infection and the severity of the disease. The vaccination rate of people infected with the virus is 54 percent for the first dose and 24 percent for the second, the release says.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Even though public health officials believe the risks of local transmission are low following these two cases, they recommend that at-risk individuals get vaccinated.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "\"Our vaccination rates could really be improved. It would allow us to be better protected and prevent the risk of local transmission,\" explained Dr. Geneviève Bergeron, chief medical officer of Montreal public health's prevention and control of infectious diseases department.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "\"There is no vaccine that is 100 percent effective, but we know the vaccine is effective. Among people who have received the vaccine, we see presentations that are less severe. Fewer lesions, fewer complications.\"\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The virus is transmitted through direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the lesions of an infected person or their bodily fluids. It can also be transmitted through respiratory droplets during prolonged close contact.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The main symptoms are initially fever, headaches, fatigue, chills, body aches, and lymph node inflammation. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Subsequently, there is the appearance of skin eruptions on the face and elsewhere on the body. These skin eruptions can be extremely painful.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Between May and October 2022, 400 probable and confirmed cases of mpox were diagnosed in Montreal. Throughout Quebec, there were 526 probable or confirmed cases.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The last appearances of mpox in Montreal date back to the fall of 2022.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Public health estimates that about 54 percent of the at-risk population (men who have sex with men) have had a first dose, but only 24 percent have had a second dose.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "As cases tick upwards in other cities, one Montreal men's health organization, RÉZO, is reviving an old awareness campaign. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "\"We are there to listen and to inform again about the transmission mode, about what mpox is and what are the symptoms and to continue to give the information about the vaccination sites,\" said director general Alexandre Dumont Blais.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Montreal public health says those eligible for the vaccine can make an appointment through the Clic Santé website or show up at a walk-in clinic.","The board of health for the Health Department of Northwest Michigan is scheduled to consider a resolution that could affect the department's responses to health emergencies like COVID-19.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "At the April 4 meeting in Charlevoix, the eight board members who are county commissioners from the health department's jurisdiction of Antrim, Charlevoix, Emmet and Otsego counties, are scheduled to review a resolution upholding medical freedom in light of the recent COVID-19 countermeasure experience authored by Rich Ginop, chairman of the Emmet County Board of Commissioners.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The resolution states that all state or local governmental emergency measures affecting, or emanating from the health department regarding a pandemic or epidemic, shall expire after 28 days and only a three-fourths vote of the full board of health can authorize continued implementation of such measures, and then only on a month-by-month basis. The resolution also states that the health department shall not impose, permit or enforce Covid vaccine mandates, the mandated masking or testing of asymptomatic persons.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "When asked if the 28-day expiration for health measures can be legally applied to mandates from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) or the federal government, Ginop said \"I am not sure.\"\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "\"Courts have consistently upheld MDHHS’s ongoing authority under the public health code. MDHHS will continue to use its powers under the Public Health Code to protect the lives of the people of Michigan,\" said Chelsea Wuth, a spokeswoman with MDHHS when asked to respond to the resolution.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Matthew Cross of the Plunkett Cooney law firm, who serves as legal advisor for the board of health, declined to comment.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "\"I have not had an opportunity to look over the resolution since receiving it last week and likely won’t have an opportunity to do so until closer to the meeting,\" Cross said in an email on March 27.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Last December, the state court of appeals ruled that the Ottawa County Health Officer acted legally and appropriately when she issued a pre-K-6 mask mandate during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "\"I am sick and tired of the so-called authorities lying to us and not revealing the truth about vaccine damages, deaths and injuries that are happening,\" Ginop responded when asked what motivated him to draft the resolution.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "According to a 2022 report from Johns Hopkins Medicine titled \"Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?,\" authors Lisa Maragakis and Gabor David Kelen, both MDs, said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"are very safe and very good at preventing serious or fatal cases of COVID-19. The risk of serious side effects associated with these vaccines is very small.\"Ginop believes he has the votes on the board to gain approval of the resolution. He bristled when asked if he was over reaching.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "\"They over reached (and) they are shoving it down our throats. They are spending tax dollars in the mainstream media that (the vaccine) is good for you and it's effective. There is more evidence against it then there is for it,\" he said.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "In addition to Ginop, other board members include Jarris Rubingh and Dawn LaVanway of Antrim County, Josh Chamberlain and Scott Hankins of Charlevoix County, Don Mapes from Emmet County and Henry Mason and Jonathan Turnbull of Otsego County.","The health benefits of soybeans oil are such that it helps to develop good body immune system, strengthens body tissues and organs, maintains brain function, maintains eye health, keeps teeth strong and healthy it keeps the digestive system healthy, maintains steady blood pressure, prevents osteoporosis, controlled transition of menopause, lowers the risk of breast and colon cancer, prevents anaemia");
