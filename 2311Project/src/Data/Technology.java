From cleaning your washing machine to wiping down your bathroom to cleaning out your closet, it's that time of year to really reset. And that means doing laundry. You probably already know how useful Alexa is around the house, but have you ever used your Amazon Echo device to help you do your laundry? If not, you're really missing out. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Here's several neat ways you can use Alexa commands and skills to make laundry day easier. For more tips, learn how to best wash your sheets and bedding, and learn about these laundry symbols or you might ruin your clothes. First, you'll need to time how long each load takes in your machine. Rather than standing in front of your washer the entire time, check the machine after half an hour or 45 minutes to get a general idea.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Next, go into the Alexa app and tap the menu button (the three horizontal lines) and tap Routines. Tap the plus sign to create a Routine. With Alexa, you cannot just set a timer in a Routine, but there is an easy workaround. In the When this happens part of the Routine, select Voice, and then type in whatever you want to say to Alexa to start the timer -- something like \"Alexa, start my washing machine timer.\"\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Next, tap Add action and select Wait. Select the amount of time it takes for your washer or dryer to complete a load of laundry. Finally, tap Add action, Alexa says, and type in whatever you want Alexa to say to you when the time is up.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The next time you throw a load of laundry into your washing machine, start the Routine by saying the trigger phrase. Can't remember the last time you washed your sheets or your favorite hoodie? Just have Alexa remember for you using the Laundry Mate skill.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "When you wash something, say, \"Alexa, tell Laundry Mate I washed my [bedding/or other item] today.\" When you need a reminder ask, \"Alexa, when was the last time I washed my (item).\"\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Consult these guides if you want to know how often you should wash your sheets or clean your bathroom. ", "China's cyberspace regulator will conduct a cybersecurity review of products sold in the country by U.S. memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology, the regulator said on Friday. The move is aimed at protecting the security of the supply chain for critical information infrastructure, prevent hidden risks and safeguard national security, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a brief statement.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "It gave no other details, including which Micron products it was reviewing.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Micron, one of the world's largest memory chip makers, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Shares in Micron fell 3.3% in pre-market trading after the announcement.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The move comes amid a spat over chip technology between Washington and Beijing. The United States has imposed a series of export controls on chipmaking technology to China for fear it could be used to produce chips for applications such as artificial intelligence which could be used by China's military, and blacklisted a number of China's largest chip firms, including Micron rival Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd. On Friday, Japan announced it would align its technology trade controls with a U.S. push to curb China's ability to make advanced chips. The Netherlands, which makes advanced lithography equipment critical for the manufacture of advanced chips, made a similar announcement earlier this month.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Micron makes NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market as well as DRAM chips that are widely used in data centres, personal computers and other devices. It is the only major U.S. manufacturer of DRAM memory, and competes with South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics in the product category.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The company has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, the company announced it would shut its DRAM design operations in Shanghai. \r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Taiwan-based chip maker United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) and China’s Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd, alleging the companies conspired to steal trade secrets from Micron.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Fujian Jinhua denied the allegations. UMC pled guilty to the charges and paid a $60 million fine", "Netflix launched its new cheaper ‘Basic with Ads’ subscription tier back in November 2022 and the streamer is finally bringing it to the tvOS app. TechCrunch spotted a post from Redditor u/websgeisti, who noted that Basic with Ads was now working on their Apple TV. Specifically, it started working following an update to version 2.3.0 of the Netflix tvOS app. Moreover, Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that the tvOS app now supports Basic with Ads.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Before the update, subscribers on the Basic with Ads tier would be asked to try a different device or upgrade their subscription when trying to use the service on Apple TV.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "While it’s good to see Basic with Ads available on Apple TV, there are still platforms that don’t have support. Notably, some of Google’s Chromecast devices, as well as the Netflix app on PS3 and Windows. Netflix had a rocky few months. After launching the ad tier, the company beat new subscriber expectations in its Q4 2022 report, though it’s not clear how much the Basic with Ads tier impacted that. The company went on to launch new paid password-sharing rules in Canada, sparking backlash and calls from Canadians to cancel. However, 46 percent of respondents to a MobileSyrup survey about the new rules said they were still sharing passwords. Seven percent reported they had been kicked off someone else’s account and 43 percent said they switched to another service.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Earlier this month, Netflix started emailing former customers trying to lure them back. Instead of offering a deal or discount, though, the streamer tried to use nostalgia and its new Basic with Ads plan.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "And if you did cancel Netflix, well, here are some alternate streaming platforms to check out — most of them support Apple TV too.");
