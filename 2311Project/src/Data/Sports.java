			+ "with the Toronto Six winning the PHF championship last Sunday. Not only was the Isobel Cup game a nail-biter that went into OT, it was a moment for Canadian women's hockey to be proud of. Over the last few \r\n"
			+ "years, I have attended a number of Toronto Six games and the crowds have grown to a committed fan base and the vibe is excellent.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "To see this organization grow, and be successful is something very important in the women's hockey community. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Next up were some epic results from the pool at the Canadian Swimming Trials. Summer MacIntosh smashed the world record in the 400-metre freestyle and then continued by topping her own world junior record \r\n "
			+ "in the 200m individual medley. Josh Liendo and Maggie MacNeil also dominated in their events. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "I also want to share this beautiful story from my CBC Sports colleague Devin Heroux about Maggie Mac Neil's journey back from taking a year off to prioritize her mental health. This is just a continuation of \r\n "
			+ "Mac Neil's journey in the pool and out of it, but sharing that she needed to take time off is important.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "\"I realize everyone goes through struggles and it's OK to have those struggles,\" she said.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The fact that she isn't shying away from addressing mental health struggles and needing to adapt her schedule to it, may be helping other athletes. Healing for each person is different and I'm grateful that \r\n "
			+ "she invested in herself.I saw a great segment on CBC Kids with Skylar Park, the Taekwondo phenom from Winnipeg. Park explains the history and culture of Taekwondo. It's a fun segment and her energy is infectious.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Park finished her most recent season with a bronze medal at the Grand Prix Final in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Let's talk about how amazing women's college basketball is. It brought me a lot of happiness to learn that the viewership numbers for the NCAA women's basketball playoffs are decimating the men's. The reason this \r\n "
			+ "matters is because for far too long, the narrative that no one watches women's sports was dominating sports culture.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "This tournament is flipping that on its head, and rightfully so. We've reached the final four and the excitement is unreal. The tickets for the women's games are more expensive than the men's games. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Just some fun data for the naysayers. \r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ " \r\n"
			+ "Last and not least … dates! As the month of Ramadan continues I have had quite a few designer dates! This particular dried fruit is a natural superfood and Muslims eat one to break the fast. Medjool (Moroccan but \r\n"
			+ "grown in the Middle East, South Asian and Africa) and Mazafati (Iranian) dates are the most popular in my home.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "There are a few women in the Greater Toronto Area and in other cities across Canada who prepare premium chocolate covered dates, stuffed dates and date truffles. Dates have been traditional used in sticky toffee \r\n "
			+ "pudding but this newer trend to stuff them with nuts or coat them in chocolate is one of my favourite things. When you have been fasting all day, to be able to taste this rich, delicious date combined with nuts \r\n "
			+ "are not only packed with protein but a delight and treasure for the tastebuds.","Russian and Belarusian players will be able to compete at Wimbledon as neutral athletes after the All England Club on Friday \r\n "
					+ "reversed its ban from last year.The players must sign declarations of neutrality and comply with “appropriate conditions,” including not expressing support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. “This was \r\n"
					+ " an incredibly difficult decision, not taken lightly or without a great deal of consideration for those who will be impacted,” All England Club chairman Ian Hewitt said in a statement.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The players cannot receive funding from the Russian or Belarusian states, including sponsorship from companies operated or controlled by the states.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus and Russian players Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev are among the players who can return.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned the reversal as “immoral.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“Has Russia ceased its aggression or atrocities? No, it’s just that Wimbledon decided to accommodate two accomplices in crime. I call on the UK government to deny visas to their players,” Kuleba \r\n"
					+ " wrote on Twitter.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Other tennis tournaments have allowed Russian and Belarusian players to compete as neutral athletes — their nationalities are not listed in the brackets, official results or graphics on TV \r\n "
					+ "broadcasts of matches. But, as in some other team sports, Russia and Belarus were not permitted to participate in the Billie Jean King Cup or Davis Cup by the International Tennis Federation.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“We also consider alignment between the Grand Slams to be increasingly important in the current tennis environment,” the All England Club said.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The same conditions will apply for Lawn Tennis Association tournaments used by players as grass-court warmups for the sport’s oldest Grand Slam tournament. The women’s and men’s professional \r\n "
					+ "tennis tours last year imposed heavy fines on the LTA and threatened to pull its tournaments. The effect of being expelled from the tours, the LTA said, “would be very damaging and far \r\n "
					+ "reaching for the game in our country.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The ATP and WTA had also responded to last year's ban by not awarding ranking points for Wimbledon — an unprecedented move against the prestigious event.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“There was a strong and very disappointing reaction from some governing bodies in tennis to the position taken by the All England Club and the LTA last year with consequences which, if continued, \r\n"
					+ " would be damaging to the interests of players, fans, The Championships and British tennis,\" the club said.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "This year’s Wimbledon tournament will start on July 3. The women’s final is scheduled for July 15 and the men’s final on July 16.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“It's a beautiful tournament, beautiful Grand Slam. I'm really happy that I'm going to be able to play there this year,” Medvedev said Friday after he won his semifinal match at the Miami Open over \r\n"
					+ "fellow Russian Karen Khachanov. “I don’t know what the crowd reaction is going to be, I cannot control it, but I will be happy to play there in front of all the people. Hopefully on big courts. Hopefully have some big, amazing matches.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Also speaking in Miami Gardens, Florida, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova said Russia and Belarusian players should continue to be banned from both Wimbledon and the Olympics.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“For sure I’m just more worried about the Ukrainian people and players. I appreciate that Wimbledon had a tough time last year not giving the (ranking) points, that Belarusians and Russians didn’t play. And I think they shouldn’t be \r\n "
					+ "allowed, actually,” Kvitova said. “I’m just still a bit on the Ukrainian side of this.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Martina Navratilova, who won a record nine Wimbledon singles titles, said she supported the change. She wrote on Twitter, “as I said last year, this was a bad decision and I am glad it was reversed.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The All England Club said the conditions were developed through talks with the British government, the LTA and “international stakeholder bodies in tennis.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The club's statement described “personal player declarations” but didn't provide details. The LTA said the players and support staff “will be required to sign neutrality declarations” similar to those used in other sports.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "In a joint statement, the ATP and WTA said they were satisfied with the outcome.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“It has taken a collaborative effort across the sport to arrive at a workable solution, which protects the fairness of the game,” the tours said. “This remains an extremely difficult situation, and we would like to thank Wimbledon and \r\n "
					+ "the LTA for their efforts in reaching this outcome, while reiterating our unequivocal condemnation of Russia’s war on Ukraine.”","The Boston Bruins completed the formality of clinching the Presidents’ Trophy on Thursday night with an \r\n"
							+ "overtime win over the Blue Jackets, and they’ve already made some NHL history and aim to break another record or two before the season wraps.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "The 2022-23 Bruins already became the fastest NHL team to 50 wins (in 64 games) and 100 points (in 61 contests). Entering Saturday with a 58-12-5 record and 121 points with seven games remaining, the Bruins are still in reach \r\n"
							+ " of setting new NHL regular-season records for wins and points.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Let’s consider their chances and how the 2022-23 Bruins stack up against the greatest NHL teams of all-time. Already at 58 wins, the Bruins need to win four of their last seven games to reach 62 victories, which would tie them \r\n"
							+ "with the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings and 2018-19 Tampa Bay Lightning. They’d stand alone if they reached 63-plus victories by winning at least six of those contests. Since we last checked in on the Bruins’ historic regular season, \r\n"
							+ " the team’s slowed down ever so slightly — but really only by their outrageous standards. This relative slippage hasn’t derailed their dreams of tying or breaking the wins record, but it makes the points mark a bigger leap. With \r\n"
							+ "121 points in 75 games played, the Bruins are basically on pace (if you round up) to match the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens’ record of 132 points. It should be mentioned, however, the Canadiens accomplished that in only 80 games and \r\n "
							+ "without the benefit of shootouts, from which the Bruins have compiled three wins and nine points this season.  ");
