	public static final List<String> article = Arrays.asList("Disney+ has released a first glimpse of Suga’s forthcoming tour film, Suga: Road to D-Day. The BTS member’s solo documentary will air on Disney+ and Weverse, although a premiere date has not yet been announced.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "In the 30-second teaser, Suga can be seen on tour in cities like Seoul, Tokyo, Pyeongchang, Chuncheon, Las Vegas, Malibu, and San Francisco. The camera captures him in front of a private plane and driving through a desert at sunset.“This is my first time walking down this road,” the singer explains as he strolls down a street at night. “I’m really excited right now.” He adds, “Whenever a concert ends, and I go in [and say] ‘Ah, I’m tired.’ No, like, it’s my first time doing this in my life! Even in Korea I’ve never done this before.”\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "According to a press release, Suga: Road to D-Day will follow Suga on a “musical journey” as he travels the world “in search of inspiration in the form of new sounds and experiences.” It added that the film “will showcase Suga and his impressive skillset, giving viewers an intimate look into the life of one of the world’s biggest stars.”\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Next month, Suga will become the first BTS member to embark on a solo tour, with a slate of dates scheduled around the world this spring, including a U.S. run. The tour is notably being billed under Suga’s own name, as well as his other stage moniker, Agust D.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Suga’s Agust D tour will kick off April 26 in New York and will span the U.S. before making its way to Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and soon-to-be-announced Japan dates. Tickets are currently on sale.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "While all seven members of BTS are exploring solo projects right now (and completing their mandatory military service), Suga has been ahead of the curve for a few years now. Back in 2016, he released a debut self-titled mixtape as Agust D, then followed that project up in 2020 with another mixtape, D-2. Suga’s also recently done a lot of production work for other artists, including Psy, the Japanese singer Ømi, and his BTS bandmate Jung Kook.","Nah, Gwyneth Paltrow ’s motivation to go to trial to fight a lawsuit accusing her of sending a fellow skier “absolutely flying” at a posh Utah ski resort in 2016 was about vindication.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "She got it when a jury found her not at fault in the collision, granting her exactly the $1 she sought in her countersuit. As a court reporter read the verdict, the courtroom gallery made up mostly of her supporters exhaled while Paltrow sat next to her lawyer intently and avoided displaying emotion that could be interpreted as surprise or gloating.But the honest answer may not have done her damage.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“They live in a different world and it becomes their normal, but people are going to assume that,” Lovell said. “You can have that and people are going to know it and accept. You’ve just got to come across as humble.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Baird agreed.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“I think she was authentic,” she said. “She’s with her children, she’s worried about them.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The jury apparently found Paltrow likeable enough, returning after just 2 1/2 hours to give her a resounding win that blamed the collision 100% on Sanderson. Paltrow was awarded the $1 she requested in her countersuit, a symbolic amount that mirrored Taylor Swift’s response to a radio host’s defamation lawsuit. Swift was awarded $1 in 2017. She may also be awarded money to pay attorney fees, a decision that rests with the judge. He had not posted a decision on the online court docket as of Friday.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "His lawsuit had sought more than $300,000, though in closing arguments, his attorneys estimated damages as more than $3.2 million.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Trial lawyers are known to regularly engage in seemingly friendly repartee with witnesses to try and cultivate sympathy among the jury. But many observers thought Sanderson's attorney Kristin VanOrman did the actor a major favor when she at times appeared charmed by Paltrow when she was on the stand.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "When VanOrman asked Paltrow her height and she responded “just under 5'10”,” VanOrman replied, “I am so jealous! I think I’m shrinking. I have to wear heels just to make it to 5’5”.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "VanOrman's efforts to flag for the jury that Paltrow was larger than the man she collided with were overshadowed when the actor said back: “They’re very nice.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Lovell said it was so “bizarre and ineffective” that he thought VanOrman was Paltrow's attorney when he first tuned in.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“That was ridiculous,” she said. “The jury sees that and thinks she must not be that bad if the opposing attorney likes her. She seemed star struck.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Once among the most ubiquitous leading women in Hollywood, the Oscar winner has taken fewer and fewer roles in recent years. Many now identify her more with her wellness-and-lifestyle company Goop, whose offerings have brought her ridicule in some quarters as the quintessential out-of-touch peddler of celebrity woo-woo.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "But that also makes Paltrow her own boss, who is not beholden to others for work, and has brought her a devoted set of customer-fans.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“Gwyneth has such a cult following in the lifestyle and wellness brand, and people love to see another side of their life like this,” Baird said. “I think her PR team should be using it. She’s getting way more TV time than she would any other way.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Paltrow’s fight to clear her name resonated with many of her fans, including those who braved blizzards to fill the gallery of the Park City courtroom for two weeks.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“When you are a celebrity you know that you’re going to get some of this, but that was totally over the top,” said Ann Malcolm, a Park City local who enjoys skiing at Deer Valley, the mountain where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "A crowd made up of locals and some who traveled from California to catch a glimpse of the trial snapped selfies, showed each other mockups of t-shirts that read “#Gwynnocent” and commended Paltrow for being both gracious and fighting to clear her name.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“He thought it would be an easy payday,” said David Madow, a retired dentist and avid skier who attended multiple days of court proceedings. “I was impressed with the fact that she said ‘No, I’m not gonna do that.’”","It was revealed this week that her half-sister Samantha Markle's defamation case against her had officially been dismissed by a U.S. court, Hello! reported.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Samantha, who is the daughter of Thomas Markle, Meghan's dad, claimed the Duchess of Sussex had spread \"demonstrably false and malicious lies\" to a \"worldwide audience\" during her and Prince Harry's bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview that aired in March 2021.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "PA news agency had access to court documents, confirming a Florida judge had dismissed the case due to Samantha's opinion not being \"capable of being proved false.\"\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "The docs claimed Samantha, who has appeared on numerous talk shows to criticize her half-sister, was simply voicing \"an opinion about her childhood and her relationship\" with Meghan.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "U.S. District Judge, Charlene Edwards Honeywell, wrote: \"As a reasonable listener would understand it, defendant merely expresses an opinion about her childhood and her relationship with her half-siblings.\"Thus, the court finds that defendant's statement is not objectively verifiable or subject to empirical proof…. plaintiff cannot plausibly disprove defendant's opinion of her own childhood.\"\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Amid Meghan's latest legal win, Harry made a surprise appearance in London; his first trip to the U.K. since his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in September and the release of his tell-all memoir, Spare.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Harry headed home to make an appearance at the High Court amid the lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Ltd; publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Harry and other celebrities including Elton John and Jude Law’s ex-wife Sadie Frost are suing the company over alleged phone tapping and other invasions of privacy, the Associated Press reported.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "ANL have been accused of “engaging in unlawful acts that included hiring private investigators to bug homes and cars and record private phone conversations,” AP added.");
