			+ "\r\n"
			+ "January's report was better than economists had been expecting. In a note, Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics said the January figure was above the 0.4 per cent consensus expectation of economists' forecasts.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Statistics Canada said the main drivers of growth for the month were also the largest contributors to the December decline.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "\"In January, the wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, and mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sectors all rebounded from declines recorded in the previous month,\" the federal agency said. Wholesale \r\n"
			+ "trade rose by 1.8 per cent in January, helped by wholesalers of machinery, equipment and supplies, while the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector grew by 1.1 per cent. The transportation and warehousing \r\n "

			+ "\r\n"
			+ "After remaining relatively flat in the second half of 2022, the accommodation and food services sector was also among the top contributors to growth in January, increasing by four per cent.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Advance figures for February released at the same time by Statistics Canada indicate that the economy continued to expand that month, although the 0.3 per cent increase is less than what was seen in January. The \r\n"

					+ "dilapidated tear-down on West King Edward near Queen Elizabeth Park.Emma, in her late 20s at the time, had just been hired by the University of British Columbia as a medical researcher. Ian, in his early 30s, \r\n "
					+ "was working as a camera technician in the movie industry. They bought the two-storey home, built in 1938, for $362,000. Emma’s family in England thought it was an outrageous price.The couple, juggling the \r\n "
					+ "demands of caring for two kids under two and their full-time jobs, got to work making the house a home, first addressing structural issues to make it livable and then, over the next decade, \r\n"
					+ "remodelling parts of the home.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“(Ian) is really handy and I can paint and swing a hammer so we worked on the house ourselves,” Emma said. “It’s the only way we could afford to do it at the time because we were at the early stage of our careers.”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "They even built a treehouse in the backyard where their kids, Matthew and Megan, would have sleepovers.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Now, with their children in their 20s and looking for places of their own, Emma and Ian decided to sell the home that’s been the scene of 22 years worth of barbecues, graduation parties and games of fetch with their dog, \r\n "
					+ "Pepper.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The home, now assessed at $2.9 million, will hit the market this month along with six other homes in a land assembly. The seven homes will be torn down to make way for a townhouse development that will span half the block.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“We’ve sort of held out as long as possible,” Emma said, noting that developers and realtors have knocked on their doors in recent years as townhomes and four- to six-storey condo buildings popped up around them. “These all \r\n "
					+ "used to be single-family homes on King Edward,” she said. “Every time we go for a walk in the neighbourhood, we’re like, ‘Wow, there’s a hole in the ground and six houses are gone.'”\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The single-family home, which for decades has been a symbol of the middle-class dream in Canada, is in steep decline. In its place are townhomes, multiplexes and low-rise apartment buildings, not just in Vancouver but in \r\n "
					+ "cities across B.C.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Urban planners and housing advocates say that’s the only way to overhaul a real-estate landscape that has left so many people behind.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The debate over so-called missing-middle housing has been divisive. It’s pitted neighbours against one another. It has led to tense debates in local council chambers, largely between the property haves and have-nots: homeowners \r\n "
					+ "who worry more density will strip the character from their neighbourhood versus those who want an end to a status quo that’s kept them out of the real estate market.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "According to the Metro Vancouver Housing Data Book published in December, 62.4 per cent of the net new occupied dwellings built in the region between 2016 and 2021 were apartments, followed by 15.5 per cent row houses. Just 7.9 per \r\n"
					+ " cent were single-detached houses.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond and Surrey — in that order — added the largest number of apartment units.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "The total number of single-detached homes in Metro Vancouver declined from 301,000 to 288,000 between 2011 and 2021. This decline in single-family homes is happening even in family-rich suburbs like Surrey and Richmond. \r\n"
					+ "Over the same period, the number of apartments in the region grew to 452,000 from 357,000.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "In Greater Victoria, the number of new single detached homes declined from 860 in 2021 to 679 last year, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Housing advocates, architects, developers and B.C.’s housing \r\n"
					+ "minister say the single- family home will not disappear. What is more likely to phase out is single-family zoning that limits density in residential neighbourhoods.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Vancouver city council, for example, is considering whether to legalize buildings with up to six units on a single-family lot on low-density residential side streets.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Even municipalities more resistant to density might not have a say in the matter.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Premier David Eby’s Housing Supply Act, which will take effect later this year, will set housing targets for municipalities, reinforced through a carrot and stick approach. The carrot for municipalities that meet those targets \r\n"
					+ "include provincial cash for amenities such as parks, bike lanes and recreation centres. The stick will be that the B.C. government can overrule local governments and rezone entire neighbourhoods to create more density.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Arny Wise, an urban planner and retired developer, said simply creating more supply will not bring down prices. The laws of supply and demand, he said, simply do not work in a housing market that has been co-opted by speculators, \r\n"
					+ "real estate investment trusts and hedge funds.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "Government policy, Wise said, should require new builds to have 50 per cent below-market housing, up from the current standard of 20 to 30 per cent.\r\n"
					+ "\r\n"
					+ "“Unless there’s a change in policy … the single family home will only be for wealthy people and the children of wealthy people when the wealthy people die,” Wise said.", "U.S. stocks closed sharply higher Friday, following a \r\n"

							+ "\r\n"
							+ "How stocks traded\r\n"
							+ "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 415.12 points, or 1.3%, to close at 33,274.15.\r\n"
							+ "The S&P 500 gained 58.48 points, or 1.4%, to finish at 4,109.31. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 208.44 points, or 1.7%, to end at 12,221.91.\r\n"
							+ "For the week, the Dow gained 3.2% while the S&P rose 3.5% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.4%. The Dow and S&P 500 each booked its best week since November, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "For the month, the Dow rose 1.9%, the S&P 500 increased 3.5% and the Nasdaq jumped 6.7%.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "In the first quarter, the S&P 500 advanced 7% and the Dow edged up 0.4%. The Nasdaq soared 16.8% in the first three months of 2023 to notch its largest quarterly percentage rise since the second quarter of 2020.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "What drove markets\r\n"
							+ "U.S. stocks ended sharply higher Friday, closing out March with monthly and quarterly gains, as investors weighed data showing signs of moderating inflation.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "“Core price pressures” eased in February, Barclays said in an economics research note Friday. “On balance, the easing in February PCE inflation was fairly broad-based across goods and services, barring housing.”\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "The personal-consumption-expenditures, or PCE, price index increased 0.3% in February, with inflation slowing to 5% year over year from 5.3% in January, according to a report Friday from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge that excludes energy and food prices, rose 0.3% last month for a year-over-year rate of 4.6%. That’s slightly lower than forecasts from economists polled by the Wall \r\n "
							+ "Street Journal and softened from the 4.7% increase seen over the 12 months through January. While the Federal Reserve has been battling high inflation with interest rate hikes, futures traders are betting that rates have \r\n "
							+ "already peaked and that the Fed will likely reverse course and cut rates at least a couple of times before the end of the year, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "The market is pricing in a “coin flip” as to whether the Fed raises its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point at its May policy meeting or pauses, said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth \r\n"
							+ " Management Co., in a phone interview Friday.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "“We think we’re getting pretty close to the end” of the rate-hiking cycle, he said. Stucky expects the Fed may stop hiking once “cracks” start to form in the labor market, with job losses in “nonfarm payrolls.”\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Meanwhile, consumer spending edged up 0.2% in February while personal incomes rose 0.3%, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis report Friday.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "“Incomes and spending are hanging in there and inflation’s cooling,” said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist, in a phone interview Friday. “That has positive implications for markets” and the economy, he said.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "Stocks traded higher following the release of the final reading on U.S. consumer sentiment for March from the University of Michigan. While confidence ticked lower compared with earlier estimates, inflation expectations moderated.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "U.S. stocks have held up relatively well this quarter, shrugging off the Fed rate hikes and renewed recession fears. Since hitting its highest level of the year in early February, the S&P 500 has been trading in an increasingly \r\n "
							+ "narrow range, leaving analysts uncertain about where the market might be heading next.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "“We need to see what the overall economy does,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, founder and chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners. “I think GDP matters, and if GDP holds up while inflation comes down, that could be good for stocks.”\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "The Nasdaq Composite has risen 16.8% this year through March, for its biggest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 2020, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 rose 7% in the first quarter while the Dow eked out a 0.4% quarterly gain.\r\n"
							+ "\r\n"
							+ "“The bond market is definitely more concerned about recession risks than stocks are,” said Skordeles, who is expecting a recession in the second half of the year. “They couldn’t be sending more different signals.”");
